/*
 * Generalized Stencil API: Descriptor and Field Types
 *
 * This API supports the construction of stencils in arbitrary dimensions, with pole (direction/offset) arrangements determined by user-supplied geometry or by iterative solvers.
 *
 * Field Types:
 * - Rectangular (Cartesian): Poles are axis-aligned, e.g. 6-point, 14-point, or 27-point stencils in 3D.
 * - Interaction Field (formerly "polar"): Poles are arranged according to a set of states with defined mutual interactions (attractive, repulsive, etc.), not to be confused with polar coordinates. This is a generalization where each pole's position and weight may be determined by a field of mutual influences, not just geometric distance.
 *
 * Terminology:
 * - "Interaction Field" is used here to describe a set of states (poles) with defined mutual reactions, as opposed to "polar field" which may be confused with polar coordinates.
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1. Rectangular: A 3D 27-point stencil (all neighbors in a 3x3x3 cube).
 * 2. Interaction Field: A 6-pole arrangement where each pole's position is iteratively solved based on attractive/repulsive forces from the other poles, e.g. for meshless PDEs or neural field models.
 * 3. Custom: User supplies N poles in D dimensions, with a state resolver that encodes arbitrary interaction rules (e.g., energy minimization, equilibrium, or even learned arrangements).
 *
 * The state resolver callback allows contributors to define the rules for pole placement and adjustment, enabling the stencil geometry to be the solution to a state equation in n-dimensional continuous physics or other interaction-based systems.
